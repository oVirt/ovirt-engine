# Event Filter #
#--------------#

# First match algorithm for include/exclude events.
#
# Filter syntax
#
# FILTER=[PATTERN ...]
# PATTERN=include|exclude:event[:severity][(subscriber)]
#
# Filter logic
#
# Each (event E, severity, subscriber S) tuple is checked against each
# include/exclude pattern in turn, and the first pattern match is acted upon:
# if it is an include pattern then E is sent to S;
# if it is an exclude pattern then E is skipped for S;
#
# The event '*' matches everything.
# A missing severity and the severity '*' matches everything.
# A missing '(subscriber)' matches all subscribers and should only be used for excludes.
#
# Message constants can be found at:
# @ENGINE_DOC@/AuditLogMessages.properties
#
# Valid severity values in increasing order of severity include:
#   'NORMAL', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'ALERT'
# An inclusion filter with a given severity will match all events of greater-or-equal severity;
# an exclusion filter with a given severity will match all events of lesser-or-equal severity.
#
# examples:
# FILTER="include:VDC_START(smtp:mail@example.com) ${FILTER}"
# FILTER="exclude:VDC_START include:*(smtp:mail1@gmail.com) ${FILTER}"
# FILTER="include:*:ERROR(smtp:mail2@gmail.com) ${FILTER}"
#
# The final filter list contains FILTER  as well as 'event_subscriber' table records.
# database records are considered first.
