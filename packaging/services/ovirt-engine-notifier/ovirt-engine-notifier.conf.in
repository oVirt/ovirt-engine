# Extra system properties to be added to the java virtual machine
# of the notifier. Properties can be specified using the typical
# java syntax:
#
#   -Dmy.param=my.value
#   -Dmy.flag
#
# If the -D prefix is not used it will be automatically added, so
# the following is also valid:
#
#   my.param=my.value
#   my.flag
#
# If several properties need to be specified they should all go in
# the same line and separated by spaces:
#
#   -Dmy.param=my.value -Dmy.flag -Dyour.param=your.value

# Notification Service Configuration: #
#-------------------------------------#
# Interval (in seconds) between iterations of dispatching messages to subscribers. Default is 120 seconds.
INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS=120

# Idle task interval
# Interval in seconds to perform low priority tasks.

FAILED_QUERIES_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENTS=

# This parameter specifies how many days of old events are processed and sent
# when the notifier starts. If set to 2, for example, the notifier will
# process and send the events of the last two days, older events will just
# be marked as processed and won't be sent. The default is 0, so no old
# messages will be sent at all during startup.
DAYS_TO_SEND_ON_STARTUP=0

#--------------#
# Event Filter #
#--------------#

# Filter logic.
#
# First match algorithm for include/exclude messages.
# Entry is message|*(subscriber|*)
# * = all messages/all subscribers.
# * as a subscriber should be used only for exclude.
#
# Message constants can be found at:
# @ENGINE_DOC@/AuditLogMessages.properties
#
# examples:
# FILTER="include:VDC_START(smtp:mail@example.com) ${FILTER}"
# FILTER="exclude:VDC_START include:*(smtp:mail1@gmail.com) ${FILTER}"
#
# The final filter list contains FILTER  as well as 'event_subscriber' table records.
# database record are considered first.

# SNMP profile support

# Multiple SNMP profiles are supported.

# If running Jboss in secure mode, and wishes to ignore hostname verification, should set to true. Default is false.

# verification means that it will not be verified against the certification, therefore certification errors are ignored.
